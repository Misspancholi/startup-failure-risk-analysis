Startup Failure Risk Analysis & Prediction
- Problem Statement :

Analyze startup funding and survival patterns to identify key predictors of business failure and build a predictive risk model.

- Dataset :

66K+ startup records
Cleaned to 41K after preprocessing
Features include funding, rounds, survival duration

🔧 Project Workflow

1. Data Cleaning & Missing Value Handling
2. Feature Engineering (survival years, failure flag)
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Logistic Regression Modeling
5. Class Imbalance Handling
6. Feature Improvement (Funding Rounds)
7. Risk Scoring
8. Power BI Dashboard

- Key Insights :

Startups with fewer than 3 funding rounds show nearly 2x higher failure risk.

Funding continuity is a stronger predictor than total funding amount.

Failure recall improved from 12% to 87% after feature enhancement.
